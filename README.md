# SLM-from-Scratch
Let us build a Small Language Model (SLM) from scratch. We will try to keep the parameter size to 50-60 million.  Our goal is to generate creative and coherent text based on the input data.

## How to use?

This repository contains files related to generate, train and use SLM based on the "TinyStories" dataset. The complete process of Model creation is divided in following steps.

### Step 1: Get the dataset
* Get the 'TinyStories' dataset from the `datasets` module. To perform this action, run the `load_dataset.py`.
